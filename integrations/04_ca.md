## Use the certificate authority API to clean and re-sign agent certificates.

****

First save the authentication stuff in an environment varibale:

    @@@ Sh
    $ export CERT_OPTIONS=" \
        --cert /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/yourname.localdomain.pem \
        --key /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/yourname.localdomain.pem \
        --cacert /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem"

Delete the certificate for your agent:

    @@@ Sh
    curl -X DELETE ${CERT_OPTIONS} \
        https://overlord.localdomain:8140/puppet-ca/v1/certificate_status/ \
        yourname-agent.localdomain?environment=production

Start a puppet run to send a new certificate request:

    @@@ Sh
    $ puppet agent -t

Use the API to sign the request of your agent:

    @@@ Sh
    $ curl -X PUT --data '{"desired_state":"signed"}' \
        -H "Content-Type: text/pson" ${CERT_OPTIONS} \
        https://overlord.localdomain:8140/puppet-ca/v1/certificate_status/ \
        yourname-agent.localdomain?environment=production
